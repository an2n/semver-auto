Semver Auto automates precise version updates in package.json based on dependency changes

In summary, this script is a solution for private Node.js projects, addressing challenges related to versioning, dependency management, and project consistency. By automating version updates based on dependency changes, it not only simplifies the development process but also ensures that version numbers accurately reflect the evolution of the project.

## Motivation:

This script serves as a valuable tool for managing and versioning Node.js projects, particularly when working on private repositories. The key motivations for using this script lie in its ability to streamline the versioning process and enhance collaboration within a development team. Here are the primary motivations:

Automated Versioning: The script automates the versioning process based on changes in dependencies, ensuring that your project's version reflects the evolution of its underlying components.

Dependency Tracking: By monitoring changes in both dependencies and devDependencies within the package.json file, the script provides an efficient way to manage and track dependencies across the development lifecycle.

Consistent Environment: The script helps maintain a consistent development environment by facilitating the synchronization of dependencies and versions among team members. This ensures that everyone works with the same set of dependencies and reduces potential compatibility issues.

Change-Driven Versioning: The script intelligently determines the appropriate version change (major, minor, or patch) based on the nature of the changes in the dependencies. This makes versioning more reflective of the impact of updates on the project.

Documentation and Metadata: The package.json file serves as a central repository for metadata and project configuration. The script leverages this to keep crucial information up-to-date, enhancing documentation and project management.

Enhanced Script Management: Beyond versioning, the script provides a foundation for managing custom scripts and automation tasks. This can include tasks like testing, building, or any other development-related operations.
